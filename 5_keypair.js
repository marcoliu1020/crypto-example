/**

  Using a shared key works for encryption works, 
  but the problem is that both parties must agree upon the key. 
  
  This is problematic in the real world 
  because it’s not practical or secure to share across a network.
   
  The solution is to use an algorithm like RSA 
  that generates a keypair containing a public and private key. 
  
  As their names indicate, the private key should be kept secret, 
  while the public key can be shared freely.
